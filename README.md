# React Native Tutorial

To get familiar with React Native, I worked through [part 10 of Full
Stack Open's course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part10). My intention
was not to complete the full exercises (lots of styling skipped :D),
but to gain enough experience to be familiar with React Native at a high level
(i.e. core components, routing, debugging, etc.).

To run, clone the repository and start the app with `yarn start`. Note that
you'll need to have [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/) installed and your
[development environment setup](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part10/introduction_to_react_native#setting-up-the-development-environment).
